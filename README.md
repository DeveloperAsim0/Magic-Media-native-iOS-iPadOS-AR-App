# Magic Media

Magic Media is a native iOS/iPadOS application that focuses on augmenting physical forms of media such as magazines, dollar bills, instruction manuals, etc. It delivers its users various options to interact with several sections of the physical media with images/text and then convert them into videos or 3D models specifically. This will help the user understand the information better in various ways of interaction, which is majorly made possible by AR. It also supports voice commands to help the user navigate through the app and have a more friendly and immersive experience.

5. Now, you can press the “Build” button on the top left corner for building the app on your iPhone or iPad. Make sure the device is unlocked while the app is being built.
6. If the app doesn’t open and give a permissions error on your device, then head over to Settings -> Your name (at the very top of the screen) -> Scroll down to a button that says “Developer” and then give permission for the app to run on your iPhone/iPad.
7. This should get the app working on your iPhone/iPad and now, you’re all set to enjoy its features.

**NOTE:** In order to experience audio within the app, make sure your device is not in silent mode. The physical media files that the app supports are in a folder called “Supported Physical Media”. Make sure to either access these files on a tablet kept horizontally surface or print them in preferably two pages (side by side) format.
